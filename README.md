## Protecting your users with Circuit Breakers

Description:

> The inevitability of failures is the bane of scaling any modern web service and can be a deal breaker when the API failing is something you depend on! Lucky for us, there are techniques that can help protect your product and handle failures in subsystems gracefully. This talk will dive into one of these in depth, the Circuit Breaker pattern, and explore the options it gives us for keeping our users happy when APIs are failing.

> We will be focusing on several real-world problems and how they can be addressed by circuit breakers. You should expect to leave the talk with details on simple circuit breakers as well as understanding how they can be adapted for more complex situations.
